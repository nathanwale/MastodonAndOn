This is a barebones Mastododon client that I wrote. I called it *MastodonAndOn,* and I apologise for that, I just couldn't think of a better one.

It's useable, but I wouldn't recommend it as an actual Mastodon client. For that reason, it's not on the App Store. You can, however, look at the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nathanwale/MastodonAndOn) and try running it for yourself. 

If you are looking for a Mastodon client, I'd recommend the [IceCubes App](https://github.com/Dimillian/IceCubesApp). I'm pretty happy using this one on a daily basis.
